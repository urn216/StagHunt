# StagHunt

A look into the game theory problem known as the "Stag Hunt".

Actors must decide either to work together to hunt a stag for greater reward, or work independantly to hunt hares for a smaller reward without any risk of betrayal.

This program aims to use a Value Iterator to show the different conditions that lead to either cooperation or individualism, with the ultimate goal of reaching a stable population of cooperators.
